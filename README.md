- CUDA (optional, for GPU acceleration)

### Install from Source

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Nsfr750/NeuralNetworkApp.git
   cd NeuralNetworkApp
   ```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment** (recommended):

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   # On Windows:
   .\venv\Scripts\activate
   # On Unix or MacOS:
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. **Install the package in development mode with all dependencies**:

   ```bash
   pip install -e ".[all]"
   ```

   Or install with specific features:

   ```bash
   # Core functionality only
   pip install -e .
   
   # With visualization tools
   pip install -e ".[visualization]"
   
   # For development (includes tests and docs)
   pip install -e ".[dev]"
   ```

## Quick Start

### Launching the Application

1. **Start the GUI Application**:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Using the Interface**:

   - **Network Creation**: Use the visual interface to build neural networks
   - **Training**: Configure and start training with real-time monitoring
   - **Tools Menu**: Access utilities like the Log Viewer
   - **Language**: Switch between English and Italian from the menu

### Building Your First Neural Network

1. **Launch the application** and navigate to the network creation section

2. **Configure your network**:

   - Set input size (e.g., 784 for MNIST)
   - Add hidden layers (e.g., 128, 64)
   - Set output size (e.g., 10 for MNIST classes)
   - Choose activation function (e.g., ReLU)
   - Configure dropout rate if needed

3. **Create the model** and proceed to training

### Training Your Model

1. **Load your dataset** (e.g., MNIST, CIFAR-10)

2. **Configure training parameters**:

   - Number of epochs
   - Learning rate
   - Optimizer (Adam, SGD, etc.)
   - Loss function
   - Batch size

3. **Start training** and monitor progress in real-time

4. **Evaluate performance** using the built-in metrics and visualizations
